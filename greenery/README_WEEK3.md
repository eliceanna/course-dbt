## Part 4 

**Answer:** 
```
Installed dbt-metrics and added a model called order_period_over_period which includes secondary calculations on the primary metric - orders such as WoW, weekly AVG for a specific month and rolling avg. Primary metric is defined in the core_schema.yml and the macro is called in the orders_period_over_period.sql

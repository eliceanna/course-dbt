## Week 4

### Questions:

_Q1: How are our users moving through the product funnel?_
_Q2: Which steps in the funnel have largest drop off points?_

```
A: Around 80% of users who viewed a product page, moved on to add a product into their carts. 
From those who added something to their shopping cart, only 77% went on to the checkout page. This is also the funnel step where we notice the highest drop off - 23% of users add things to their cart but don't purchase them.

_Q3: If your organization is using dbt, what are 1-2 things you might do differently / recommend to your organization based on learning from this course?_

```
A: Tbh, our dbt setup is actually quite good and consistent with dbt best practices, so there isn't much to recommend. I took this course to be able to understand the setup better and to be able to take on more engineering tasks in the future. 
One thing we might want to add is exposure for some of the important reports.
